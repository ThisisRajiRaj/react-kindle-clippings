## How to find and save your Kindle highlights file 
You can find your Kindle notes and highlights when you connect
your kindle to your computer. Your highlights are saved in a 
file named "My Clippings.txt" in the root folder of the mounted
path of your kindle.

Copy this file, and save it as "KindleClippings.txt" to a public
URL which you will pass into this React component as a property
