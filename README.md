[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-kindle-clippings.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-kindle-clippings) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-kindle-clippings
```

## Using the component in your React App
To use the KindleClippings React component in your own React app/web page,
follow the steps below
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import KindleClippings from 'react-kindle-clippings'

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <KindleClippings url="[URL to fetch kindleclippings.txt from]" />
  }
}
```
## How to find and save your Kindle highlights file 
You can find your Kindle notes and highlights when you connect
your kindle to your computer. Your highlights are saved in a 
file named "My Clippings.txt" in the root folder of the mounted
path of your kindle.

Copy this file, and save it as "KindleClippings.txt" to a public
URL which you will pass into this React component as a property

## To publish to NPM
I followed the instructions here [[https://dev.to/ramonak/how-to-publish-a-custom-react-component-to-npm-using-create-react-library-4bhi]] and 
used the following to bootstrap the project:

`` npx create-react-library [my project name] ``

This sets up everything needed to publish to NPM, and all I had to in the end
was to simply run

`` npm publish ``
